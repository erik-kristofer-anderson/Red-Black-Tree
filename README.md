This is a computer science education project that started out as an assignment for comp 271 at Loyola in Fall 2019. It started as an idea to implement a red black tree to improve my understanding of the data structure, but I realized that it's also an opportunity to analyze data on the properties of red black trees.

Some helpful PDF documents are available in [share_results](https://github.com/erik-kristofer-anderson/Red-Black-Tree/tree/master/share_results), a folder in this repo.

I will also be bloggin about this on DEV.to. Here's what I've written so far:
[Investigating tree height of a red black tree](https://dev.to/erikkristoferanderson/investigating-tree-height-of-a-red-black-tree-2pbh)  
[I'm implementing a Red Black Tree in Python](https://dev.to/erikkristoferanderson/investigating-tree-height-of-a-red-black-tree-2pbh)
